## Devuan Chimaera Minimal Image

Tested on RPi3A+ / RPi3B+ / RPi 3B / RPI 3 / RPi 400**

UID/PWD: 
```
pi / pi
root / <no password>
```

You'll need to set a root password when you first login:
`$ sudo passwd root`

And you'll most likely want to resite the root partition to fill the remaining space of your card.

## CoC desaster on LinuxCNC

Maybe some of you have read the ongoing debate about CoC & linuxcnc. Some people think they have to play policemen for the good of the others. Well, that's not my point of view. As there is no debate allowed over that topic and these policemen think their management bull * * * t is without alternative .. well, I think my LinuxCNC ISO remaster is not wanted any more, so I have deleted all remasters for amd64/raspberrypi/Orangepi. I wish these policemen good luck in destroying communities - they will prevail, without doubt.

***My LinuxCNC remasered ISOs will not be availabe any more - say thank you to the policemen .. and don't forget: OBEY***
