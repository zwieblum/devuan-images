***Devuan Chimaera Minimal Image***

Tested on RPi3A+ / RPi3B+ / RPi 3B / RPI 3 / RPi 400**

UID/PWD: 
```
pi / pi
root / <no password>
```

You'll need to set a root password when you first login:
`$ sudo passwd root`

And you'll most likely want to resite the root partition to fill the remaining space of your card.

***CoC desaster on LinuxCNC***

Maybe some of you have read the ongoing debate about CoC & linuxcnc. Some people think they have to play policemen for the good of the others. Well, that's not my point of view. As there is no debate allowed over that topic and these policemen think their management bull * * * t is without alternative .. well, I think my remaster is not needed any more. I wish these policemen good luck in destroying commumities - they will prevail, without doubt.

***So my repo will not be availabe any more. Say thank you to the policemen .. and don't forget: OBEY***
