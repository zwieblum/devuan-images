# devuan-images

This dumpyard is dedicated to my systemd-free remasterings based on devuan + extras. All images default to german localisation and keymap,

## OrangePi PC Plus

* Devuan on top of Armbian, with TDE:

Sorry, image with LinuxCNC for now. The last available RT kernel does not activate USB.

## OrangePi Zero (LTS)

* Devuan on top of Armbian, without X11: https://github.com/zwieblum/devuan-images/releases/tag/20200926-1
* Devuan on top of Armbian, with LinuxCNC 2.7.15:

You can run LinuxCNC over SSH or forward the dispplay without SSH to your computer - or you install VNC and use that for the GUI. 

## All Images

Write the image to the sd-card:
`xz devuan-beowulf-orangepipcplus-tde-2.3GB-20200926.img > /dev/sdXXX`

You will want to expand the image to take all the remaining space. Use `gparted`, but do not move the partition to the - otherwise you will overwrite the bootloader. 

User accounts are **root** / **root** and **user** / **user**. 

### Post-installation tasks:

Remove my ssh key (in case I forgot): `rm /root/.ssh/autorized_keys /home/user/.ssh/autorized_keys`
Change keyboard: `dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration`
Change locales: `dpkg-reconfigure locales`
TDE full installation: `aptitude install tde-trinity`
